## Getting Started

### Windows Users
In order to run this program, you will need to install the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows).
This is provided by the Orcale foundation and is lightweight and safe to install.

Now that you have the Java Development Kit downloaded, download the files in this repository by clicking the green button titled `code` and downloaded the .zip folder. 

Once you have the zip folder, open your file explorer and unzip the files, by right-clicking and selecting extract.

Once you have the extracted folder enter this folder, and then hit Shift+right-click on the folder titled `bin` and select `Open Powershell window here`.

You should have a pane that resembels the following.

Now to run the program, simply type `java App` into the powershell environment.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

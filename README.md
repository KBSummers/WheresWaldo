## Getting Started

In order to run this program, you will need to install the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows).
This is provided by the Orcale foundation and is lightweight and safe to install.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
